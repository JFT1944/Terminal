11. R: Attempt to remove the file hierarchy rooted in each file
                 argument.  The -R option implies the -d option.  If the -i
                 option is specified, the user is prompted for confirmation
                 before each directory's contents are processed (as well as
                 before the attempt is made to remove the directory).  If the
                 user does not respond affirmatively, the file hierarchy
                 rooted in that directory is skipped.

F:  Attempt to remove the files without prompting for confirma-
                 tion, regardless of the file's permissions.  If the file does
                 not exist, do not display a diagnostic message or modify the
                 exit status to reflect an error.  The -f option overrides any
                 previous -i options.
